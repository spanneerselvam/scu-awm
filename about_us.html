  <div class="heading_about">Our Mission </div>
    <div class="content"><p> <center> Our goal is to
    mentor and encourage young women and other students at SCU as they prepare for
    careers in the mathematical sciences and STEM fields. We want to empower
    women to pursue their dreams and passion for mathematics so that they are
    unstoppable.

  <div class="title3">Our Story </div>
    <div class="content1"><p> <center> AWM's chapter at SCU was originally started
      by the late Professor Jean Pederson, who's love for math and her students
      was illustrated through her teaching and mentorship of AWM.
      AWM used to only have one event--which is now  known as our "Math Murder
      Mystery Night"--and only three members... Two years later,
      over 60 students have enrolled in AWM and are participating in our exciting events!
      AWM continues to foster support towards their members as
      they pursue careers in the STEM field. </center> </p></div>

  <div class="title4"> Tamsen McGinley </div>
  <div class="content1"> <p>Professor McGinley is one of the coolest math
    professors at Santa Clara University and the advisor of AWM. She is truly
    the mother hen of SCU's Math and CS department. In addition to
    being an incredible professor, she is know for her AMAZING superpower:
    her beautiful handwriting! She also has a great sense of style and fashion
    (if you ask her students). When she's not at SCU, she's out running with her dogs, leading her son's
    Eagle Scout troop, volunteering on PTSA, and being active outdoors.
    She loves camping in the mountains but her favorite place to be is the beach.</p></div><br></br>

  <div class="title4"> Saigopini (Sai) Panneerselvam </div>
  <div class ="content1"> <p>Sai (prounuced "sigh"), is a senior
    double major in computer science and mathematics. She has been a part of AWM
    since she was a freshman! She loves 
    designing websites (like this one!) ad participating in hackathons.
    In her free time, she enjoys hiking,
    teaching her dog named Merlin new tricks, singing at the convalescent home,
    reading, and baking. And if Sai could be any animal, she would probably be
    a seahorse... Feel free to say hi--she doesn't bite and she's always
    ready to help! She's so excited to get to know each and every one of you!!!
